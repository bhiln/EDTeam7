{\small How to submit: Place a PDF document with the link/title ``Sequence Diagrams'' in your group's resources folder and make a link to this on your group's Wiki page. Your page must be readable on a web browser.

The purpose of this assignment is two things:
(1) Help you work through the functioning of your design in detail given the sequence and block diagrams that you have created.  This can allow you to identify things that you have not fully considered or problems in the design (e.g., do you have enough queues on the PIC or is that something we need to discuss?).
(2) Lay out the design of your system prior to implementing the software (beyond the i2c functionality from MS \#1 and \#2).  This will help you avoid having to start over or do a major re-design due to a design that isn't fully thought through.  It will also help the team members to all be clear on how the system functions, what is sent and when in the system, etc.
 
Your paper should include a list of references at the end for any material discussed in the paper. Your paper should be in 12 pt font, single-spaced, with 1'' top, bottom, left, and right margins.
