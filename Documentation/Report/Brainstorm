Robots are used in many environments because there is alot of noise in the sensors, there is uncertainty about what task should be done, and difficulty modeling the environment. We are not concerened too much with modeling the environment as we are given a map of it. Most previous work implements reasoning
as reactive system. One weakness of many robotic control systems lies in their dependence on specific robotic devices. Ideally, when one sensor fails, you would want to have another one ready that can be used by the high level framework just as well. Solution: seperate low level control with high level planning.
