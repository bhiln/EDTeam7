{\small How to submit: Place a PDF document with the link/title ``Project
Requirements'' in your group's resources folder and make a link to this on your
group's Wiki page. Your page must be readable on a web browser. What to submit:
Two-page paper per group, formatted as specified below\\
 
You are to specify what requirements that you plan for your project design to
meet. Please keep in mind that this document does not describe how those
requirements will be met or specify the design that you will use to meet the
requirements. You may, in some cases, find diagrams to be useful in describing
the requirements. This document will be used to judge both the difficulty of
the project as well as your success in meeting the requirements. You should not
devote significant portions of the document to repeating the specification that
was given by the instructor for the project.\\[\baselineskip]\par}
