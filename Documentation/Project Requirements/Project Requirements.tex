\subsection*{Purpose}
The purpose of the project is to design a rover that can traverse a room autonomously and be able to locate and drive over ramps.

\subsection*{Functional Requirements}
The ARM board must perform all complex tasks. 

\subsection*{Technical Requirements}
All software must be written in \texttt{C}/\texttt{C++} and must use the example code framework. Additionaly, the only hardware used must be an ARM board and PIC 18s. The ARM board may not power any other components and may only communicate to other components through I2C, USB, or Ethernet and to other processors through I2C or Ethernet. Additionaly, the rover must be remote from the ARM board.

\subsection*{Environmental Requirements}
The rover should be able to be given a map of a large room and be able to use onboard sensors to find its location on the map and the location of ramps. The rover should then be able to
