The following is the validation schedule for Igor Janjic.

September 30th:
Communication protocol describing motor commands in the Commander thread
(commanderTask.h, commanderTask.c) will be written.

October 1st:
DataConductor thread will be completely written.

October 2nd:
Skeleton for each sensor thread will be written. All communication from the ARM
system will be written and working. Dropped I2C requests will be determined and
counted. The decision algorithms deciding when to send motor commands will be
filled with stub code until they are written later.

October 7th:
Algorithms determining the rover's location and ramp locations will be decided.
Base code for these algorithms will be written.

October 9th:
Decision algorithms will be functional alowing a demonstration of simulated
data to correctly show rover location on the map.

October 14th:
All data processing will be written. Ramp locations will be determinable using
the developed decision algorithms. Demonstration of decision algorithms with
simulated data will be performed. Ramp location discovery and rover discovery
will be demonstrated.

October 17th:
Movement commands implementing rover motion parallel to a wall will be written.

October 19th:
Movement commands implementing obstacle avoidance motion will be written.
Motion parallel will be demonstrated.

November 4th:
Movement commands implementing navigation around a ramp will be written. Motion
parallel to a wall will be demonstrated.

November 10th:
Movement commands implementing navigation across a ramp will be written.

November 15th:
Preliminary functionality of the rover will be demonstrated.

December 9th:
Final rover functionality will be demonstrated.
