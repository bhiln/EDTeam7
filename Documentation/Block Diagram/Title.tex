You are to create and document a diagram of the hardware design for your project. The design should include all components with a computational, communication, sensing, or actuating function. It should exclude power-related components. The communication between components should be precisely identified in the diagram, including the physical connection (e.g., 2 wires), the lower level protocol (e.g., I2C), and the nature of the data being communicated (e.g., 10-bit sensor data). If the communication is bi-directional, this should be identified and documented.  Each component (e.g., sensors, processors, etc.) in the diagram should have a specific model number (e.g., PIC18F2680).  The assignment of tasks from your task diagram must be specified in this document.  Please refer to the example diagrams and the discussion in class.\\[\baselineskip]\par}
