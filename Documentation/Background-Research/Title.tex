Assignment" in your group's resources folder and make a link to this on your
group's Wiki page. Your page must be readable on a web browser. What to submit:
Two-page paper per group, formatted as specified below.

You are to gather, summarize, and analyze existing work on your project topic.
The purpose of this assignment is for your group to obtain a thorough picture of
what design approach have been explored and the issues that have arisen. Your
paper should reflect this understanding so that it can be a starting point for
your own project design. Your paper should not be a series of summaries nor
should it be a list of who has done what.

Your paper should include a list of references at the end for any material
discussed in the paper. Your paper should be in 12 pt font, single-spaced,
