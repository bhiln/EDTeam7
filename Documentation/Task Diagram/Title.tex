You are to describe your project design as a task graph in which the tasks (nodes of the graph) and the communication between tasks (edges of the graph) are clearly described. You need to clearly identify all sensor input and actuator output (e.g., motor controller) as nodes in the graph. At this stage of the design process, you do not have to identify any specific model numbers for components (e.g., IR sensor is enough, you don't need the specific model yet). Communication should be specified in terms of the type of data being sent and the approximate rate at which it is to be sent.
